# Spec: [Title]

## Context

## Non-Goals

## Requirements and Outcomes

### OUT-001: [Short name]

[Observable outcome]

_Architecture: immutable `#spec-traceability` link labeled OUT-001, plus relevant selectors._

## Acceptance Criteria

- AC-001 **[Short name]**: [Binary observable criterion]
  - Covers: OUT-001
  - Architecture: [Immutable #spec-traceability link labeled AC-001, plus relevant selectors]

## Spec Invariants

_One row per checkable grill axiom. `Form` takes one
[Form](../../tdd/properties.md#form) value
(`example | property | stateful-property | model | type`); `Pattern` names its
[Property Pattern](../../tdd/properties.md#property-patterns) or `none`; `Seam`
names the public interface the test drives; `Model` names the Model file or
`none`. Write `none` when the spec has no Spec Invariant._

| INV | Rule | Source (Q anchor) | Form | Pattern | Seam | Model |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| INV-001 | **[Short name]**: [Rule the code must keep] | [Q link] | [Form] | [Pattern or none] | [Seam] | [Model or none] |

## Constraints

## Dependency Readiness

_Write `No Stack Required` when no dependency exists. Otherwise write `Ready`
and list each dependency's immutable landing or branch/base evidence._

## Branch/Base Intent

_When accepted intent exists, record for each Touched Repository the intended
branch, parent or base, child branch constraint, and supporting evidence. One
plan creates at most one pull request per Touched Repository; split or stack PRs
only when the user explicitly asks. Otherwise write `Not applicable`._

## Architecture Source

_Verified immutable blob URL (also in `links`), commit, path, and content identity
of the current retained sibling `ARCHITECTURE.md`._

## Accepted Technical Decisions

_Preserve accepted architecture constraints and exact technical details with
source-question IDs or decision selectors. Link the companion for explanation._

## Accepted Testing Decisions

## Verification Seams

_Name the public interface, event, state transition, command, or observable
boundary used to verify behavior. If none applies, record the accepted
not-applicable rationale._

## Prototype Verdicts

_For each applicable verdict: outcome, immutable commit SHA, artifact path, and
accepted implications. Remove this section when no prototype exists._

## Parked Decisions

_Each item needs an owner and resume trigger. Remove this section when empty._
