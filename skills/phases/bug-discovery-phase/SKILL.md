# Bug Discovery Phase

Readonly ClawPatch discovery. Produces reports, finding state, triage notes,
and ranked next actions. Does not prove runtime root causes or patch code.

Load [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) before running ClawPatch.

## Contract

- Owns ClawPatch setup checks, bounded discovery scope, report/state paths,
  finding IDs, branch relevance, and triage notes.
- Default scope is PR changes, highlighted diffs, supplied code portions, or
  certain paths/domains. Full-codebase scan only when no PR is open and no
  certain scope exists, or when the user explicitly asks.
- Pass that bounded scope to every ClawPatch command or prompt that accepts
  scope, path, or diff guidance.
- Allows `init`, `map`, `review`, `ci`, `report`, `show`, `next`, `triage`,
  `status`, `doctor`, and `revalidate`.
- Blocks source mutation by default, including `fix --finding` and `open-pr`.

## Steps

1. Bound the run: repo, scope, provider/model default or explicit override,
   limit, jobs, state dir, report path, dirty posture, and output format.
2. Use the current agent/launcher provider by default; add provider/model
   flags only when the user selected a ClawPatch override.
3. Inspect readiness with `doctor`, `status`, and existing `.clawpatch/` state.
4. Run discovery and report generation within the bounded scope.
5. Inspect important findings, rank them `0-10`, and route each to resolution,
   debugging, debt docs, false-positive triage, or stop.
6. Stop before mutation unless the user makes a new explicit resolution request.

## Output

Return scope, provider/model default or override, limit/jobs, report and state
paths, commands run, finding IDs/statuses, rank rationale, static-review caveat,
and next action.
