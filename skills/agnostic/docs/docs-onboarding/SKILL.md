# Docs Onboarding

Use this skill to turn an existing repository into initial Harness wiki context after `hi init`.

## Workflow

Before naming or rewriting domain concepts, read the canonical glossary in the
routed `requirements-grill` status artifact. Preserve its canonical terms;
route proposed terminology changes through `requirements-grill` instead of
silently renaming them.

1. Read repo guidance and the existing project-owned wiki guidance.
2. Read any existing backlog provider and wiki framework decisions. Resolve
   their locations from project guidance; `hi init` does not generate those files.
3. Discover backlog context:
   - Probe the pinned remote backlog provider first when connector/tool/auth access exists.
   - Inspect local backlog clues after that: existing specs, issue matrices, backlog markdown, project docs, and `.devpunks` metadata.
   - Treat remote backlog evidence and local clues as equally important and mandatory when available.
   - If either lane is missing or inaccessible, ask the developer for the backlog location or access path before assuming no backlog exists.
4. Build and persist the Project Map before asking developer questions.
5. Run a targeted `requirements-grill` against the Project Map for project-wide
   reconstruction decisions.
6. Activate `write-backlog`'s backlog-initialization branch to reconcile the
   Product/Backlog Root, Product Areas, Initiatives, `V*` context, and saved
   views from accepted wiki and provider evidence.
7. For every candidate existing flow accepted by the onboarding grill, invoke
   `requirements-phase` with its confirmed status/log and Project Map evidence.
   Require `create-architecture` before `create-spec`, then record the retained
   pair and its readiness result. Pass the onboarding projection boundary:
   an agent-ready spec and its mapped architecture may reach `write-backlog`
   only when reconstructed evidence already supplies the exact existing Epic/Story
   and accepted projection authority required by that branch. Otherwise record
   the missing authority and exact human Finder invocation; retain the compiled
   pair and return a blocked backlog delta without provider mutation. Onboarding
   never invokes a Finder implicitly and does not create higher-level placement.
8. Update onboarding navigation and indexes using
   [references/artifact-contract.md](references/artifact-contract.md).

## Discovery Depth

Inspect entrypoints, routes/pages, commands, API handlers, schemas/models, tests, config/env examples, and existing docs.

Do not deep-read every implementation file by default. Deep-read implementation files only when needed to explain a flow, resolve a contradiction, or map a data boundary.

## Targeted Grill

Grill contradictions, missing backlog location, unclear feature ownership and
inferred requirements before either compiler runs. Observed code-only facts may
remain `Inferred` in the Project Map as evidence; they become accepted requirements
or design choices only through confirmed intent and the recorded grill decisions.
Pass unresolved material decisions back to `requirements-phase`; an inferred
current implementation is not permission to choose architecture or requirements.

## Resumability

Persist the Project Map and grill status before developer questions. On resume, continue from saved discovery/grill state instead of rescanning from zero.

## Guardrails

- Code can prove observed behavior, not original intent.
- Reconstructed spec history must be evidence-backed.
- Do not invent implementation notes, rationale, or tech-debt history without supporting artifacts.
- Use only `write-backlog` for physical provider mutation.
