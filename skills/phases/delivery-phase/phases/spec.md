# Spec Phase

Use this phase when the required Architecture/SPEC pair, its backlog
projection or its execution plan is missing, stale or conflicting. Apply the
[Architecture/SPEC Pair Complete gate](../references/artifact-state.md#architecturespec-pair-complete),
the
[Backlog Projection Complete gate](../references/artifact-state.md#backlog-projection-complete)
and the [Plan Complete gate](../references/artifact-state.md#plan-complete).

Before naming or rewriting domain concepts, read the canonical glossary in the
routed `requirements-grill` status artifact. Preserve its canonical terms;
route proposed terminology changes through `requirements-grill` instead of
silently renaming them.

## Delegate

Return the bounded goal, exact artifact/decision gap and current source pointers
to Requirements Phase. It owns `requirements-grill -> create-architecture ->
create-spec -> write-backlog`, then `create-plan`. Pass optional Finder context
only when supplied. Reuse matching current retained artifacts; unsettled
decisions return to `requirements-grill` before either compiler runs. A missing
or stale plan with a current pair and projection returns to Requirements Phase
for its `create-plan` step only. Full Delivery starts Requirements Phase and
other modes propose it, per
[Confirm to continue](../../ask-hi/references/phase-graph.md#confirm-to-continue).

## Completion State

Verify the retained Architecture/SPEC pair and its exact identities, verified
immutable blob URLs and source selectors. Backlog projection must name that
spec identity and satisfy the Backlog Projection Complete gate. The retained
plan satisfies the Plan Complete gate. Compiler
readiness needs no additional approval gate.

Emit the [common Phase Result](../references/context-continuity.md#common-phase-result)
with pointers to the resulting proof or exact gap. Continue only in Full
Delivery; otherwise stop at the requested boundary.
