description: Coordinate aggressive parallel subagent fan-out for readonly work. Use when Codex is researching, auditing, updating docs, investigating multiple hypotheses, or exploring unrelated code paths without writing code. Do not use for code-writing tasks, tightly coupled edits, or work that is faster to finish locally on the critical path.

# Parallel Research

Use this skill only for readonly workflows. Goal: widen coverage fast, keep prompts clean, then synthesize before acting.

## Decide Fast

1. Confirm the task is readonly.
2. Confirm the work can be split into independent questions or areas.
3. Keep the immediate blocking step local. Delegate only sidecar work that can run in parallel.
4. Skip this skill for code writing, patching, rebases, commits, or tightly coupled debugging that needs one continuous thread.

## Split Cleanly

- Split by hypothesis, subsystem, artifact set, or question.
- Give each subagent one concrete ask.
- Avoid overlap. Two agents should not answer the same unresolved question unless cross-checking is the explicit goal.
- Prefer small batches, usually 2-4 subagents.

## Prompt Minimally

- Pass raw artifacts, paths, errors, or files.
- Do not leak your preferred answer, suspected fix, or private conclusions unless the task truly requires them.
- Ask for findings, evidence, and file references.
- For validation passes, make the prompt look like a normal user request, not a hidden test of the skill.

## Run In Parallel

1. Spawn subagents once the split is clear.
2. Keep working locally while they run. Synthesize, inspect source, or prepare follow-up questions.
3. Wait only when their output is needed for the next step.
4. Reuse an existing agent for related follow-ups instead of spawning duplicates.

## Synthesize Before Acting

- Compare outputs against the repo, docs, or other primary artifacts.
- Resolve disagreements with evidence, not majority vote.
- Extract the few facts that matter, then decide locally.
- Close agents that are no longer needed.

## Good Fits

- Auditing separate features for regressions
- Researching several code paths before planning
- Checking multiple hypotheses for a bug without editing code
- Updating docs after parallel fact-gathering
- Reading unrelated subsystems to build context quickly

## Bad Fits

- Implementing production code
- Writing tests or making repo edits
- One small question that is faster to answer locally
- Work where every step depends tightly on the previous sub-step
- Delegation that would just duplicate your own immediate next action

## Output Contract

Return:
- what each subagent covered
- the evidence worth trusting
- conflicts or uncertainty
- the synthesized conclusion
- the next local action
